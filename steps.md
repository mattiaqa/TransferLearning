# General Steps

Transfer learning involves adapting a pretrained model to a new task. Here are the general steps of transfer learning:

1. **Select a pretrained model**: Choose a pretrained model that was trained on a large dataset for a similar task. Common choices include models pretrained on ImageNet for computer vision tasks or models like BERT for natural language processing.

2. **Add specific layers**: Introduce new layers that are specific to your target task. These layers are typically unfrozen and will be trained using your task-specific data.

3. **Training**: Train the modified model on your task-specific dataset. During training, the weights of the added task-specific layers are adjusted, while the weights of the pretrained layers remain fixed.

4. **Fine-Tuning**: Depending on the performance on your task, you might choose to fine-tune the pretrained layers by unfreezing them. This allows the model to adjust its knowledge to better suit the specifics of your task.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your transfer learning model on a separate test dataset. This step helps you assess how well the model has adapted to the new task.
