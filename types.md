# Type of Transfer learning

### Transductive Transfer Learning
Involves transferring knowledge from a source domain to a closely related target domain. This proves valuable when labeled data in the target domain is scarce or absent.


### Inductive Transfer Learning
Occurs when the source and target domains align, but the tasks differ. The pretrained model, already familiar with the source data, speeds up learning for new functions.
